# 2d_ik_solver
A simple inverse kinematics solver for an arm in 2d

## About
This is an implementation on an inverse kinematics solver for an arm with variable number of joints in a two dimensional coordiante system.

## Dependecies
  * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
  * [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

## Build
  1. Generate a Makefile or a project file using cmake! On Windows you might have to set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH variable to the path to the Eigen and SDL2 include and lib folders separated by semicolons.
